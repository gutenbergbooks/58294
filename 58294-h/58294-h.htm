<h2 id="c1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>Every American wants to have at least
a speaking acquaintance with the trees
that make up our great national heritage,
the unequalled forests of North America.
The camper, the tramper, the woodsman,
the gardener, the motorist, and the inquisitive
school girl and boy, all wish to
know the names, the uses, and the
ranges of our native trees. There are
more than 400 tree species in North
America, north of Mexico, and in so
small a book it is impossible to include
all. Species from every section of the
country have been selected so that this
little book is as serviceable near San
Francisco as near New York, in Alaska
as in Georgia, and throughout Canada.</p>
<p>The names of trees are confusing to
learn only because lumbermen, farmers,
foresters, guides, and botanists all have
different names for the same tree. Again,
one name, like Bull Pine or Scrub Oak,
may be applied to a dozen kinds of trees,
in different regions. It has been thought
best in most cases to use only one name,
chosen from the least provincial and most
literate sources. The Latin names are
those now used at the great Arnold
Arboretum, except in a few cases that
might confuse the beginner.</p>
<p>Measurements and other characterizations
of trees in the text apply to mature
growths of the season or to trees at the
height of their life cycle, not to early
spring condition, nor to the appearance
of saplings or ancient, decrepit trees.
Particularly the shape as described applies
to trees growing in the open. Under
crowded forest conditions all trees tend
to have spindling outlines. At the limits
of their ranges many trees become mere
shrubs. They develop most luxuriously
near their centers of distribution.</p>

<h3>CALIFORNIA NUTMEG
<br />(<i>Torreya californica</i>)</h3>
<p class="bet"><span class="sc">Shape</span> with a pyramidal head, becoming round topped in age, 15-90 ft. tall. <span class="sc">Bark</span>
smoothish, thin, dark gray-brown, fissured into narrow ridges. <span class="sc">Branches</span>
spreading, slightly pendulous. <span class="sc">Needles</span> flat, scattered along the twigs, the undersides
marked with two whitish lines. <span class="sc">Fruit</span> olive-like or plum-like, green becoming
purple-streaked, consisting in a fleshy aril in an open pit of which is
buried the nutmeg-like seed. <span class="sc">Range</span>: n. Coast Ranges and central Sierra Nevada
of Calif. Of tree size only near the coast, this curious tree is unlike any other in
America except FLORIDA YEW (<i>Torreya floridana</i>) a little tree, rare in nw.
Fla. with dark purple flesh on the fruit. PACIFIC YEW (<i>Taxus brevifolia</i>) has
short, slender, yellowish-green needles and a scarlet fleshy coat around the seed.
Alaska to Mont., and Sierra Nevada.</p>

<h3>LIMBER PINE
<br />(<i>Pinus flexilis</i>)</h3>
<p class="bet"><span class="sc">Shape</span> broadly round topped; 40-50 ft. tall. <span class="sc">Trunk</span> massive, short. <span class="sc">Bark</span> on
young growth light gray, on old breaking into scales, furrowed and finally black.
<span class="sc">Branches</span> whorled and open. <span class="sc">Needles</span> in clusters of five, stout, rigid, short, forming
clusters at branch ends. <span class="sc">Cones</span> 3-4 in. long; scales thick; seeds not winged.
<span class="sc">Range</span> Albt. to w. Tex., mts. of the Gt. Basin and up the e. slopes of the Sierras;
rare on the Calif. side. WHITE BARKED PINE (<i>Pinus albicaulis</i>) similar, with
silvery bark, short needles, small cones, and edible seeds. Goes to the timberline
in the Rockies and Pacific Coast Ranges. SILVER PINE (<i>Pinus monticola</i>) resembles
the next species but has stouter, rigid leaves without white lines. A splendid
timber tree reaching 150 ft. Mont. to Ida., s. in the Sierras to Calif.</p>

</div>
<h3>WHITE PINE
<br />(<i>Pinus Strobus</i>)</h3>
<p class="bet"><span class="sc">Shape</span> pagoda-like, up to 250 ft. tall. <span class="sc">Bark</span> bluish-black, smooth or in age
forming large plates. <span class="sc">Branches</span> whorled on young trees, horizontal. <span class="sc">Needles</span> clustered
in fives, soft, slender, 3-4 in. long, bluish-green with white lines. <span class="sc">Cones</span> often
curved, 4-6 in. long. <span class="sc">Range</span>: Newf. to Gt. Lakes region and Minn., s. from the
Virginias on the mts. to Ga. The wood is light, soft, even-grained and beautiful,
used for interior finishing. &ldquo;Soft Pine&rdquo; has played a great role in our history. In
the days of wooden battleships it made the tallest masts. Appreciated by the first
colonists, it was wildly exploited in the last century. Railroads were bent to great
stands of it, wooden cities and mushroom fortunes arose from its exploitation and
great fleets were built to export it. Now desolate stump lands tell the decline of an empire.</p>

<h3>SUGAR PINE
<br />(<i>Pinus Lambertiana</i>)</h3>
<p class="bet"><span class="sc">Shape</span> with a broad, flat topped crown. <span class="sc">Trunk</span> up to 220 ft. tall, massive, usually
clothed with branches to the ground. <span class="sc">Bark</span> smooth, dark gray on young
branches, thick and scaly on old trunks, the plates purplish brown to cinnamon.

The strong, ruddy wood is greatly in demand for bridges and buildings. Masts
and spars made from it went round the world in the old clipper ships. Often erroneously
called &ldquo;Norway Pine&rdquo; (a name also given to a European spruce) this is
what the old lumberjacks of the North Woods meant by &ldquo;Hard Pine.&rdquo; This
stately, colorful pine is one of the most picturesque of our trees.</p>

YELLOW PINE (<i>Pinus scopulorum</i>) differs in little except its shorter stature
(not over 75 ft.), shorter needles, often in clusters of 2, blackish bark, and smaller,
stouter cones. Black Hills and Big Horn Mts., high lands of w. Neb., and
Rockies from Wyo. to N. Mex. Both are among the most important timber trees

varieties of this important tree, the upland wood which is hard and heavy, much
valued for interior finish, and a weak, fast-growing type from lowlands. BLACK
PINE (<i>Pinus rigida</i>) has dark needles in threes, 3-4&frac12; in. long, and cones 2-2&frac12;

The wood is soft, coarse grained and
brittle in the case of second-growth trees.
Formerly virgin Loblolly timber (now
rare) was among the strongest and most
durable of American pine woods. The
man-of-war &ldquo;Roanoke&rdquo; carried an immense
mast cut from N. C. Loblolly that

Gulf States, up to e. Tenn. The wood,
strong and durable when not tapped for
turpentine, is used for interior finish,
bridges, trestles, masts, spars and especially
for railway carriages. This valuable
tree, with the longest needles and largest
cones in the eastern states, is the great
tar, pitch, and turpentine tree that has
supplied the world with most of its naval
stores. With the vanishing of virgin
timber, the flow of turpentine has become
greatly diminished. SLASH PINE
(<i>Pinus caribaea</i>) is a similar, very slender

Mistassinie and the Mackenzie R., skirting
well south of James&rsquo; Bay; Gt. Lakes
region to centr. Minn. Though of little
value save for fuel, this tree grows in
acid, rocky country where no other tree
would. Everywhere associated with poor
soil, poverty, and bleak conditions, it is
called &ldquo;Unlucky Tree&rdquo; and superstitiously
feared by French Canadians. The

this tree has the largest cones among
all pines. DIGGER PINE (<i>Pinus Sabiniana</i>)
is similar, ranging in a circle of the
lower mts. surrounding the interior valleys
of Calif. Shape an open, broom-like
crown, trunks usually leaning and soon
forking umbrella-wise. Needles grayish,
scanty, clustered at twig ends, 7-13&frac12; in.

Also called Tamarack Pine, this lofty
slender tree makes dense monotonous
forests from the Yukon along the Rockies
to s. Colo. and Utah, and along the
Sierras to s. Calif. It is used for mine
timbers, railway ties, and its very tall,
slender, straight stems furnished the
western Indians with tepee poles. BEACH
PINE (<i>Pinus contorta</i>) differs in being
a stunted tree of bogs, shores, and windswept
dunes from Alaska to Calif.; stems
twisted: hark thick and dark; head broad
and picturesque; needles darker green,
1-1&frac12; in. long. The two species intergrade,

basin, n. Mississippi basin, N.E., N.Y.,
n. Pa. The wood, heavy, strong, rather
coarse, is durable in contact with the
soil. It is employed for ship timbers,
ties, and fence posts. The gum was used
as a wound balm by the Pilgrims. When
leafing out in spring the Larch is very

Mts. of B.C. to w. Mont., and s. to the
Blue Mts. of Ore. No other American
conifer produces such hard, heavy wood;
this is terra cotta in hue, valued for
house construction and furniture. Aided
by the thickness of its bark this tree
withstands forest fires better than any
other in the West and remains the king

Sequoia, when, &ldquo;with their slender stems
and large graceful leaves nicely balanced
on the long stalks against the faint light
filtered through the high forest canopy,
they are in pointed contrast to the titanic
features of the Redwood.&rdquo; (Jepson).
BLACK MAPLE (<i>Acer nigrum</i>) is very

over its wide range, sometimes with foliage
white- or yellow-margined or
spotted, this river bank tree passes unnoticed
in the e. forest belt, but owing to
its ability to stand drought, wind, cold,
and heat, it is highly appreciated on the
prairies and semi-deserts for shade.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
